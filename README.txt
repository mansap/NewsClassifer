1. The code is developed in Python3.

2. To run the program, the file path upto the 20_newsgroups folder needs to be provided as
   the command line argument.

3. The 'stopWords.txt' file must be present in the same folder where textMining.py is present.

4. To run the code, type the following: python3 textMining.py pathname_of_20_newsgroups
   For example, in the CS machines, the path is '/home/adjunct/tmh/pub/newsgroups/20_newsgroups',

   To run the code, type the following:
   python3 textMining.py /home/adjunct/tmh/pub/newsgroups/20_newsgroups

5. The model will print the accuracy for the test data set and validation data set along 
   with corresponding confusion matrices.
